The Zest™ SDK comes with several sample applications. This is a very good place
to look for code examples and recipes.

The samples are available in the +samples/+ directory of the Zest™ SDK.

[[sample-dci, DCI Sample]]

[[sample-sql-support,SQL Support Sample]]
== SQL Support Sample ==

NOTE: This sample use PostgreSQL and drop all of its data once run in order to be runnable multiple times.

Sample of how to fully use Zest™ SQL support : <<library-sql>>, <<extension-es-sql>> and <<extension-indexing-sql>>.

Here are the steps needed to setup the database using the `psql` utility command:

[source,bash]
----
user@host $ psql postgres
postgres=# CREATE USER jdbc_test_login WITH PASSWORD 'password';
CREATE ROLE
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE jdbc_test_db;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE jdbc_test_db TO jdbc_test_login;
GRANT
postgres=# \q
user@host $  psql -d jdbc_test_db</strong>
postgres=# CREATE EXTENSION ltree;
CREATE EXTENSION
postgres=# \q
user@host $
----

From the sources you can run the `runSqlSupportSample` Gradle task to run the example.
See <<build-system>> if you need some guidance.
