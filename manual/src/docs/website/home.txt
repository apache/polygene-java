versions documentation.

== What is Qi4j™? ==
The short answer is that Qi4j™ is a framework for domain centric application development, including evolved concepts
from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming[AOP],
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection[DI] and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design[DDD].

Qi4j™ is an implementation of Composite Oriented Programming, using the standard Java platform, without the use of
any pre-processors or new language elements. Everything you know from Java still applies and you can leverage both
your experience and toolkits to become more productive with Composite Oriented Programming today.

Moreover, Qi4j™ enables Composite Oriented Programming on the Java platform, including both Java and Scala as primary
languages as well as many of the plethora of languages running on the JVM as bridged languages.

Qi4j™ is pronounced "chee for jay". This website is out of scope to explain the many
facets and history of Qi, so we refer the interested to read the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi[lengthy article] at
Wikipedia. For us, Qi is the force/energy within the body, in this case the Java platform. Something that makes Java
so much better, if it is found and channeled into a greater good.

We strongly recommend the <<intro, introduction>> section.
