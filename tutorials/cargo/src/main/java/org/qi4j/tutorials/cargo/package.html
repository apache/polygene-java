<h1>Tutorial - Cargo</h1>

<p>
    In Eric Evans' book Domain Driven Design, ISBN 0-321-12521-5, we find a domain oriented discussion
    around cargo making voyages from the starting point to a destination. The discussion in DDD is
    not continuous, so we need to find the many snippets throughout the book. We will try to
    address each piece found in the book as it appears, and how that is dealt with in Qi4j.
</p>

<p>
    We have chosen the Cargo example also due to the fact that Mr Evans uses this in presentations
    about Domain Driven Design, and that it represents exactly the type of applications that we think
    Qi4j is made for.

<p>
    In the tutorial text, I will be reference pages in the book, and it refers to my edition, i.e.
    "First printing, August 2003", which I believe to be the only edition in circulation at the
    time of this writing (Jan 2008). I will also try to reference the section in question, so if you
    read this when other DDD editions are out, you will have a chance to find it.
