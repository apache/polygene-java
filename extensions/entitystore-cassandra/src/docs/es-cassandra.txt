= Cassandra EntityStore =

[devstatus]
--------------
source=extensions/entitystore-cassandra/dev-status.xml
--------------

EntityStore service backed by a http://cassandra.apache.org/ in which Entity state is stored in single rows of a
single table.

include::../../build/docs/buildinfo/artifact.txt[]

== Assembly ==

Assembly is done using the provided Assembler:

[snippet,java]
----
source=extensions/entitystore-cassandra/src/test/java/org/apache/polygene/entitystore/cassandra/CassandraMapEntityStoreTest.java
tag=assembly
----

=== Custom Cluster Client ===
There are many options in Apache Cassandra on how the cluster is set up and how to connect to it. Instead of mapping
all possible features, a ClusterBuilder type, which by default sets it up according to this page. By overriding the
DefaultBuilder mixin, on the CassandraCluster composite, it is possible to provide your configuration.

[snippet,java]
----
source=extensions/entitystore-cassandra/src/test/java/org/apache/polygene/entitystore/cassandra/DocSupport.java
tag=assembly
----

And we then have a choice to override any of the provided extension points in DefaultBuilder. For instance;

[snippet,java]
----
source=extensions/entitystore-cassandra/src/test/java/org/apache/polygene/entitystore/cassandra/DocSupport.java
tag=builder
----

Of course, it is possible to simply override the entire Mixin and not subtype it at all.

== Configuration ==

Here are the configuration properties for the Cassandra EntityStore:

[snippet,java]
----
source=extensions/entitystore-cassandra/src/main/java/org/apache/polygene/entitystore/cassandra/CassandraEntityStoreConfiguration.java
tag=config
----

== Cassandra Authentication ==
It is possible to configure Cassandra with many types of authentication. User/password is provided in this library's
configuration, and for more advanced setups, you need to provide an implementation of com.datastax.driver.core.AuthProvider
as a Polygene service (and visible to the ClusterBuilder as usual).

== Cassandra Keyspace ==
The Cassandra EntityStore can either use an existing Cassandra Keyspace, which is the default, OR create its own
keyspace.

The CassandraEntityStoreConfiguration#keyspaceName() defines the name of the keyspace to use, or to be created. If not
defined, then the default name is "polygene".

The CassandraEntityStoreConfiguration#createIfMissing() defines if new missing resources should be created or an
Exception should be thrown if missing.

If the keyspace is created, then the CassandraEntityStoreConfiguration#replicationFactor() will define the replication
factor, defaults to 3, and the command to create the keyspace is;

[source]
-----------------
    CREATE KEYSPACE &lt;keyspaceName&gt; WITH replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : &lt;replicationFactor&gt; };
-----------------

== Polygene's Cassandra Table ==

Polygene will store all entities in a single Cassandra TABLE

[source]
-----------------
    CREATE TABLE &lt;tableName&gt; (
        id text,
        version text,
        appversion text,
        storeversion text,
        usecase text,
        modified timestamp,
        properties map&lt;string,string&gt;
        assocs map&lt;string,string&gt;
        manyassocs map&lt;string,string&gt;
        namedassocs map&lt;string,string&gt;
        PRIMARY KEY ( id )
    );
