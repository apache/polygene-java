EntityStore service backed by Berkeley DB (Java Edition) embedded database from Oracle.

The Berkeley DB is a classic among the embedded key-value databases, and for many years was not acceptable to the
Apache community and downstream users due to a restrictive license (Sleepycat license). Oracle has re-license this
to the Apache License 2.0, and enabled many projects around the world to leverage this technology.
