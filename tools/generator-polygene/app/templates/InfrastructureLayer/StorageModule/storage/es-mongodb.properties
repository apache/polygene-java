# The write concern to be used. One of the following;
#
# ACKNOWLEDGED : Write operations that use this write concern will wait for
#                acknowledgement,  using the default write concern configured
#                on the server.  This is the default value.
#
# W1 : Write operations that use this write concern will wait for
#      acknowledgement from a single member.
#
# W2 : Write operations that use this write concern will wait for
#      acknowledgement from two members.
#
# W3 : Write operations that use this write concern will wait for
#      acknowledgement from three members.
#
# UNACKNOWLEDGED : Write operations that use this write concern will return
#                  as soon as the message is written to the socket. Exceptions
#                  are raised for network issues, but not server errors.
#
# JOURNALED : Write operations wait for the server to group commit to the
#             journal file on disk.
#
# MAJORITY : Exceptions are raised for network issues, and server errors waits
#            on a majority of servers for the write operation.
