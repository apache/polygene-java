## What is Apache Polygene™

The short answer is that **Apache Polygene™** is a community based effort exploring Composite Oriented Programming for
domain centric application development. This includes evolved concepts from
[Aspect Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming),
[Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)
and [Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design).

**Composite Oriented Programming** allows developers to work with _fragments_, smaller than classes, and _compose_
fragments into larger _composites_ which acts like the regular objects. Apache Polygene™ also tackles the enforcement
of _application_ composition, i.e. composites are declared in _modules_, modules are contained in _layers_ and access
between layers are controlled/enforced.

**Apache Polygene™ (Java Edition)**, first Apache Polygene sub-project, is an implementation of Composite Oriented
Programming, using the standard Java platform, without the use of any pre-processors or new language elements.
Everything you know from Java still applies and you can leverage both your experience and toolkits to become more
productive with Composite Oriented Programming today.

The Apache Polygene™ community welcomes any effort exploring Composite Oriented Programming for domain centric
application development using any technology.
