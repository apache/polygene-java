Polygene™ comes with classes to help with testing. For general development, only a couple of classes are of interest as the
others are mostly for EntityStore and Index/Query SPI implementations. There is also some mocking support, to allow
some of Polygene's unique aspects to be mocked, but since Polygene™ is so flexible at a fine-granular level, we have found that
mocking is seldom, if ever, needed.

== Your First Testcase ==
In most cases, you will probably use the AbstractPolygeneTest class to simplify starting a Polygene™ test instance.

[snippet,java]
--------------
source=tutorials/hello/src/test/java/org/apache/polygene/tutorials/hello/HelloTest.java
tag=step1
--------------

This will do all the initialization of a Polygene™ runtime instance and create a single layer with a single module in it.
What goes into that module is declared in the assembly() method;

--------------
source=tutorials/hello/src/test/java/org/apache/polygene/tutorials/hello/HelloTest.java
tag=step2
--------------

In this case we declare that we have a ValueComposite of type org.apache.polygene.tutorials.hello.Hello which looks like

[snippet,java]
--------------
source=tutorials/hello/src/main/java/org/apache/polygene/tutorials/hello/Hello.java
tag=body
--------------

The say() method will get the _phrase_ and _name_ from its internal state (the State interface is not magical, it could
be named anything).

And then we create the actual test;

[snippet,java]
--------------
source=tutorials/hello/src/test/java/org/apache/polygene/tutorials/hello/HelloTest.java
tag=step3
--------------

By using the prototypeFor() we can access the hidden, internal and very private state of the ValueComposite. Once the
value is created we can reach this directly.
