<h2>Serialization SPI.</h2>
<p>
    This package contains specialized serialization APIs for the {@literal JSON} and {@literal XML} formats.
    See {@link org.apache.polygene.spi.serialization.JsonSerialization}, based on {@literal javax.json},
    and {@link org.apache.polygene.spi.serialization.XmlSerialization}, based on {@literal javax.xml}.
</p>
<p>
    This package also contains base implementations, mixins and helpers for serialization API implementations:
</p>
<p><strong>Base implementations</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use {@link org.apache.polygene.spi.serialization.AbstractTextSerializer}
        and {@link org.apache.polygene.spi.serialization.AbstractTextDeserializer}
        as a basis to implement the serialization API for text representations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use {@link org.apache.polygene.spi.serialization.AbstractBinarySerializer}
        and {@link org.apache.polygene.spi.serialization.AbstractBinaryDeserializer}
        as a basis to implement the serialization API for binary representations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use {@link org.apache.polygene.spi.serialization.AbstractSerializer}
        and {@link org.apache.polygene.spi.serialization.AbstractDeserializer}
        if you need to handle text/binary conversion yourself.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Mixins</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        {@link org.apache.polygene.spi.serialization.BuiltInConverters} provides built-in
        {@link org.apache.polygene.api.serialization.Converter}s for types supported by the Polygene Runtime.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Helpers</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        {@link org.apache.polygene.spi.serialization.SerializationSettings}
        can be used to register custom Converters at assembly time.
        Serialization implementations might extend this with additional specialized settings,
        see their respective documentation for details.
    </li>
</ul>
