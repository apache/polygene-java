--------------

The Qi4j Core Runtime has a number of extension points, which we call the _Qi4j Core Extension SPI_. These are defined
interfaces used *only* by the Core Runtime and *never* directly by application code.

There are currently 4 Core SPI extensions;

    * EntityStore SPI
    * Indexing/Query SPI
    * Cache SPI
    * Metrics SPI

Qi4j Runtime Extensions implementations may depend on Qi4j Libraries, but Libraries are NOT ALLOWED to depend on
Extensions. Applications code is NOT ALLOWED to depend on extensions. And application code SHOULD NOT depend on the
Core Extension SPI. If you think that is needed, please contact _Qi4j Dev_ mailing list, to see if your usecase can
be solved in a support manner, or that we need to extend the Core API to support it.
