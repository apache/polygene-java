<h2>Serialization API.</h2>
<p>
    {@link Serialization} extends {@link Serializer} and {@link Deserializer}.
    <br/>
    {@link SerializationException} is thrown when something goes wrong.
</p>
<p>
    Serialization implementations should be tagged with {@link Serialization.Format} at assembly time so that consumers
    can specify which format they need:
</p>
<pre><code>@Service @Tagged( Serialization.Format.JSON ) Serialization serialization;</code></pre>
<p>
    {@link Serializer}s and {@link Deserializers} provides methods and functions to (de)serialize objects
    and set of objects.
</p>
<p>
    Serialized representations might be textual (e.g. {@literal JSON} and {@literal XML}) or binary.
    Implementations are free to use any codec to encode/decode from/to text and bytes but it must be bi-directional.
</p>
<p>
    The serialization behavior can be influenced using {@link Serializer.Options}.
