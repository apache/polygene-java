[[core-api-dependency-injection,Dependency Injection]]
= Dependency Injection =

Polygene has a rather sophisticated dependency injection system, which is based around the <<core-api-modules>>
and <<core-api-visibility>> concepts. The dependency injection system also need help to keep the injection scopes
separated. The following injection scopes exists, some more common than others;

    * ++@This++ - injection of fragment from the same Composite instance.
    * ++@Structure++ - injection of <<core-api-structure>> organized types.
    * ++@Service++ - injection of services.
    * ++@Uses++ - injection of construction injected objects
    * ++@Invocation++ - injection of parts related to the current method invocation.
    * ++@State++ - injection of state of the composite instance
    * Custom injection scopes - managed through ++@AppliesTo++ and ++AppliesToFilter++ declarations.

[[core-api-this,@This]]
== @This ==
++@This++ is equivalent to the ++this++ pointer in the Java language, but refers to any part of the current
<<core-api-composite>>. This can either be a declared mixin type, or if not declared will be a <<def-private-mixin>>.

=== Example ===

We can simply request the injection of any type of the composite that we belong to, such as;

[source,java]
--------------
@Mixins( { OrderMixin.class, ShippingMixin.class } )
public interface Order extends HasShippingInformation
{
   :
}

public abstract class OrderMixin
    implements Order
{
    @This
    private HasShippingInformation shipping;
}
--------------

But we can have <<def-private-mixin>> instead, where the injected mixin type will be automatically added to the
composite.

[source,java]
--------------
@MIxins( OrderMixin.class )
public interface Order
{
   :
}

public class OrderMixin
    implements Order
{
    @This
    private DiscountRate discount;
--------------

[[core-api-structure-injection,@Structure]]
== @Structure ==
The ++@Structure++ injection scope is all about the types involved in the Application <<core-api-structure>> system.
The possible types are;

    * Application
    * ApplicationDescriptor
    * Layer
    * LayerDescriptor
    * Module
    * ModuleDescriptor
    * ModuleSPI
    * UnitOfWorkFactory
    * EntityBuilderFactory
    * ValueBuilderFactory
    * TransientBuilderFactory
    * ObjectFactory
    * QueryBuilderFactory
    * ServiceFinder
    * PolygeneAPI
    * PolygeneSPI

[[core-api-service,@Service]]
== @Service ==
Services are injected either in a number of ways, either direct, via List or via ServiceReference types. The following
combinations are allowed;

[source,java]
--------------
    @Service
    private MyService service;

    @Service
    private Iterable<MyService> services;

    @Service
    private ServiceReference<MyService> service;

    @Service
    private Iterable<ServiceReference<MyService>> services;
--------------

If service is not declared ++instantiateOnStartup++ during assembly, then the service will be activated on first
method invocation, and not on injection. This means that any reflection on the injected instance, may result in
unexpected behavior.

[[core-api-uses,@Uses]]
== @Uses ==
<<def-object>> and <<def-valuecomposite>> can be created with ++uses()++ declarations. This allows injection of
arbitrary types to these meta types. Only type matching will occur, so for instance only one String can be injected
this way.

If a ++@Uses++ declaration can not be satisfied from the injected objects via ++uses()++ builder method, then
if the ++@Uses++ injection is not ++@Optional++ the Polygene runtime will attempt to (in this order)

    * Instantiate a visible <<def-transientcomposite>>
    * Instantiate a visible <<def-object>>
    * Instantiate a plain object with this Composite instance as a single constructor argument.

If the ++@Uses++ is ++@Optional++ then no implict object creation will take place.

[[core-api-invocation,@Invocation]]
== @Invocation ==
++@Invocation++ injection scope is all about the current method call. It is possible to inject the following types;

    * The ++Method++ being executed.
    * Any annotation type that the method is annotated with.
    * An ++Iterable++ of either of the above

[[core-api-state,@State]]
== @State ==
This injection scope can inject either state related types.

    * ++StateDescriptor++ which holds metainfo about the state of the Composite,
    * ++StateHolder++ which allows inspection of current state of the Composite,
    * <<def-property>> to get a direct reference to a declared ++Property++
    * <<def-assocation>> to get a direct reference to a declared ++Association++
    * <<def-manyassociation>> to get a direct reference to a declared ++ManyAssociation++
    * <<def-namedassociation>> to get a direct reference to a declared ++NamedAssociation++

Custom Injection scopes are not yet supported.
