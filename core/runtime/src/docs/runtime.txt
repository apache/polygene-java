First of all, your code should never, ever, have a dependency on Core Runtime. If you think you need this, you should
probably contact users@zest.apache.org mailing list and see if your usecase can either be solved in a existing way or
perhaps that a new Core SPI Extension is needed.

include::../../build/docs/buildinfo/artifact.txt[]

Let's repeat that; *Never, never, ever depend on Core Runtime*. Make sure that the compile dependency does NOT include
the `org.apache.zest.core.runtime` jar.

== Custom AssemblyHelper ==
BUT, there are super-rare cases, where a custom AssemblyHelper might be needed. One known use-case is tp introduce
an alternative bytecode generation algorithm, either better than the one we have, or for a different system, such
as Dalvik.

To do this, add the +AssemblyHelper+ implementation instance as +metaInfo+ to the +ApplicationAssembly+

We think this is so rare, that the +AssemblyHelper+ class will remain in the +core/runtime+ module and has not
been promoted to the +core/bootstrap+ module. If you plan to use this feature, please contact the Zest development
team at +dev@zest.apache.org+ to ensure we can make this a better supported, backed by real usecases.

Fictitious example of using a hypothetical Dalvik capable classloader;
