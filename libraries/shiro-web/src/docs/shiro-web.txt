This library provides integration with the http://shiro.apache.org/[Apache Shiro] Java Security Framework.

NOTE: This library only contains web related information. Most of the documentation can be found in the
<<library-shiro>> that this very library leverages.

``Apache Shiro is a powerful and easy-to-use Java security framework that performs authentication, authorization,
cryptography, and session management. With Shiro’s easy-to-understand API, you can quickly and easily secure any
application – from the smallest mobile applications to the largest web and enterprise applications.'' says the Apache
Shiro website.

We invite you to read the comprehensive http://shiro.apache.org/documentation.html[Apache Shiro documentation], we will
mostly discuss Qi4j related matters here.

== Servlet Context ==

In a servlet context, being through the <<library-servlet>>, the <<library-http>> or your custom Qi4j application
bootstrap, plain Shiro is usable. A WebEnvironment must be globally available and ShiroFilter must be registered.

If you use a custom Qi4j application boostrap or the <<library-servlet>> you can directly use Shiro's provided
EnvironmentLoaderListener and ShiroFilter.

If you use the <<library-http>> you can either directly use Shiro classes or use the assembly API as follows:
