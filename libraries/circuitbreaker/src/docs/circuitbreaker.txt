[[library-circuitbreaker,Circuit Breaker Library]]
= Circuit Breaker =

[devstatus]
--------------
source=libraries/circuitbreaker/dev-status.xml
--------------

The Circuit Breaker library provides a way to guard your application
against faulty external systems (e.g. mail servers  being down, web
services being down). It is used by many Qi4j Extensions and Libraries.

There's a couple of differences between this implementation and others
seen on the net, but we've also heavily borrowed from others. The
first difference is that we've not focused on performance at all. For
some reason other implementations make a point about doing "atomic
changes" with various tricks, to ensure good performance. Since this is
used to guard access to external systems, where latencies range in
milliseconds and up, that seems completely useless, so we've just put
"synchronized" on all methods, which should be safe. "It works" is
better than "it's fast" for these types of things.

Second, other implementations have had really crude logic for what types
of exceptions cause the circuit to break. The most crude is "all", more
advanced ones allow exceptions that be excepted to be registered, but in
real cases this is not enough. Case in point is JDBC exceptions where
you want to fail on "connect exception" but not necessarily "invalid SQL
syntax". So instead we've leveraged `Specification` from <<core-functional,Core Functional API>> where
you get to provide your own specification that can use any logic to
determine whether a particular exception is ok or not.

Third, there's a big focus on manageability through JMX. A
circuitbreaker can be easily exposed in JMX as an MBean, where you can
track service levels and see exception messages, and trip/enable circuit
breakers.

Fourth, if an external system is unavailable due to a circuitbreaker
tripping it should be possible to expose this to other Qi4j services.
There is a standard implementation of the Availability interface that
delegates to a circuit breaker and the Enabled configuration flag, which
is what we'd suspect will be used in most cases where external systems
are invoked.

== Direct usage ==

The CircuitBreaker can be used directly, even without using anything else from the Qi4j SDK.

Here is a code snippet that demonstrate how to create a CircuitBreaker and how it behave:

[snippet,java]
----
source=libraries/circuitbreaker/src/test/java/org/qi4j/library/circuitbreaker/CircuitBreakerTest.java
tag=direct
----


== Service Circuit Breaker  ==

As a facility you can make your Services extends `AbstractBreakOnThrowable`, set them a `CircuitBreaker` as
`MetaInfo` during assembly and annotate methods with `@BreaksCircuitOnThrowable`. Doing this will :

- add a circuit breaker accessor to the Service (`CircuitBreaker getCircuitBreaker()`) ;
- allow exposition of the circuit breaker in JMX ;
- update the circuit breaker on annotated methods invocation success and thrown exceptions using the `BreakCircuitConcern`.

Here is how to declare such a Service:

[snippet,java]
----
source=libraries/circuitbreaker/src/test/java/org/qi4j/library/circuitbreaker/BreaksCircuitOnThrowableTest.java
tag=service
----

Remember to annotate methods which when they throw throwables should cause circuit breakers to trip and go back on
invocation success with the `@BreaksCircuitOnThrowable` annotation.


=== Exposing Service Circuit Breakers in JMX ===

To expose their circuit breaker in JMX, your Services using one must implement the `ServiceCircuitBreaker` interface.
Note that if you already extends `AbstractBreakOnThrowable` you don't need to do anything else as it already extends
`ServiceCircuitBreaker`.

Here is how it goes:

[snippet,java]
----
source=libraries/circuitbreaker/src/test/java/org/qi4j/library/circuitbreaker/jmx/CircuitBreakerManagementSample.java
tag=jmx
----


== Interactive sample ==

A gradle task runSample is defined in this library as a shortcut to run a
simple interactive example. You'll need a MBean client to connect to the
sample, VisualVM with its MBean plugin does the job. See <<build-system>>
if you need some guidance.
